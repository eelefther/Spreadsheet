# Spreadsheet
This project is an implementation of a spreadsheet program, created as part of the Structured Programming course at Aristotle University of Thessaloniki (AUTh) during the 2020-2021 academic year.

Program Operation Description:
Upon startup, the user defines the dimensions of the spreadsheet, resulting in a table with the specified number of rows and columns. Users can then enter data into specific cells, with the spreadsheet updating and displaying the new values accordingly. The user can choose a function such as Sum, Product, Average, Median, Minimum, or Maximum, and specify whether to apply it to a row or column. The program executes the selected function and displays the result. Throughout the process, while statements ensure correct user input by displaying error messages until valid entries are provided.
